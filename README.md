# Tunneler: Temporal Meltdown
*A Level Computer Science Programming Project*

A 2D hand-tracking adventure where you solve puzzles, navigate temporal anomalies, and survive using nothing but your wits and your trusty **Tunneler™** device.

## 🎮 Inspiration
This project is inspired by **Portal**, focusing on physics-based puzzles, momentum, and environmental interaction.

## ✋ Hand Tracking
The game uses **hand-tracking controls** to let players interact with the world naturally:
- Grab objects  
- Activate devices  
- Aim and fire the Tunneler™  
- Manipulate time-based mechanics  

## 🚀 Features
- 2D physics-based puzzles  
- Gesture-driven controls  
- Time manipulation mechanics  
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty  
- Polished UI and visual effects  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: *![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=blue)*  
- Framework/Engine: *Pygame*  
- Libraries: *CV2, MediaPipe, Threading*  
- Extras: *[any other tools]*
